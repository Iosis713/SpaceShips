My first fully finished fame so far (with Menu etc.). Previous games were playable but not finishied with GUI interface. I have done it as a learning project using SFML library.
I decided to write simply Indie game, as beeing able to track a progess is most satisfying event for me, what is quite simple with GUI.

* Confirm menu option marked by green color by clicking enter

* Steering: arrows --> movement
            spacebar --> shoot
            left ctrl --> shoot back

* Since LVL 2 self steering arrows will aim you. You can trick them between asteroids or shoot them.
